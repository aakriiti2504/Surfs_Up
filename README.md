# Surfs_Up
On my vacation in Hawaii last year, I discovered a new found passion for surfing. I have been trying to come up with a plan that will not only let me return to Hawaii but live there forever.  I finally come up with an idea that I think is interesting, a surf 'n' shake shop. 

# Purpose: 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop in Oahu. This analysis provides temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable year-round.

## Background:

W. Avy likes the analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Tasks:

This project consists of the following two technical analysis deliverables and a written report:

- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June - Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, we will filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. We will then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December - Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, we will filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December. We will then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

- Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md) - The Readme.md file will discuss the details of the project and provide an analysis, overview and a summary of the tasks completed in the project.


## Tools Used:
- 1. SQLite 
- 2. Python 3.9, 
- 3. Visual Studio Code 1.50.0, 
- 4. Anaconda 4.8.5, 
- 5. Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4, 
- 6. Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, 
- 7. Sqlalchemy.


## Results:
The three key differences in weather between June and December is discussed below:
- 1.


- 2. 


- 3.





## Summary:

Both the temperature and precipitation outcomes show that Oahu is an ideal location year-round for the intended shop. Further analysis for the remaining months is needed to confirm the temperature for these months. Apart from the temperature and precipitation, other factors to consider are humidity and wind level as well as the sources for the ingredients and equipment needed. Additional data and analysis that might be necessary to know include hotel availability for tourists in the area, the proximity of restaurants to the intended location and how many competitors exist already. Weather in Oahu perfectly suits our surfing & ice cream shop. Our work provided an depth analysis that will be very helpful and useful if our friend will decide to open another shop in the future! But thatâ€™s not all, we can also parse precipitation levels to gather more weather data for June and December.

Two additional queries were performed to get a detailed insight into our analysis. These queries are discussed below:
- 1. Precipitation details for June:
We calculated the precipitation for the month of June and the code can be found below:


After running the query we found the following results:



Hence it can be concluded that, 

- 2. Precipitation details for December:
We calculated the precipitation for the month of December and the code can be found below:


After running the query we found the following results:



Hence it can be concluded that,
